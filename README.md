# Kidney exchange program

Kidney exchange is nowaday a big issue. Several people suffer from kidney problem and need transplants.
We propose here an approach to this problem through the framework of stochastic optimization.
This repository has been made within our "Optimization under uncertainty" course given by Jeremy Omer at INSA Rennes.

## Description


## Organization


This repository contains multiple folders :

- `src\sotchastic_framework` : this folder contains all the methods implemented to solve the stochastic problem
- `src\deterministic_framework` : this folder contains some implementation for the deterministic version of the problem.
- `notebook` : this folder contains the notebook for our final evaluation
